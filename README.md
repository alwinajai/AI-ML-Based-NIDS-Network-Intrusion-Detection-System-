# AI-ML-Based-NIDS-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-
Real-time packet monitoring | Zero-day detection | Phishing detection | Automated reporting


# Overview
Traditional signature-based IDS struggle to detect modern cyber threats because they rely on static attack definitions.This project solves that problem by building a hybrid Machine Learning-driven Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) capable of detecting both known and unknown attacks in real time.

The system integrates:
1:Supervised ML (Random Forest & XGBoost)
2:Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (Autoencoder)
3:Phishing URL Detection
4:Real-time Packet Capture (Scapy)
5:Threat Intelligence Mapping (CVSS & CVE)
6:Flet-based Desktop Dashboard
7:Automated PDF Session Reporting

# Key Features
1:Hybrid Intrusion Detection
✔ Detects known attacks using ML classifiers
✔ Detects zero-day attacks using Autoencoder anomaly detection
✔ Detects phishing URLs in live traffic

2:Real-Time Monitoring
✔ Live packet capture using Scapy
✔ Color-coded threat severity in GUI
✔ Clickable packet analysis panel
✔ Real-time statistics & attack counters

3:Threat Intelligence Mapping
Each malicious packet is enriched with:
Attack category
Severity level
CVSS score
Related CVEs
Threat description 

4:Automated PDF Reports
Generate professional session reports including:
Attack statistics
Protocol distribution charts
Severity-colored packet logs
Threat summaries and CVE references

# Machine Learning Models
Supervised Models:
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost Classifier

Detects:
DoS / DDoS
Brute-force attacks
Port scanning
Spoofing
Botnet traffic

Unsupervised Model — Autoencoder
The autoencoder is trained only on normal traffic.
If reconstruction error > threshold →
➡️ Packet flagged as Anomaly (Possible Zero-Day Attack)

#🎣Phishing URL Detection
For packets containing URLs, the system checks:
Suspicious domain patterns
URL entropy and length
Special characters & keywords
Blacklist heuristics
Phishing packets are highlighted RED in the UI for quick prioritization.

# GUI Features (Flet)
Real-time scrolling packet table
Click packet → detailed analysis panel
Severity color coding
🟢 Benign
🟠 Suspicious / Anomaly
🔴 Critical / Phishing
Attack counter & live statistics
Export packet JSON
Generate PDF report with custom save location

# Report Generation

PDF reports include:
1️⃣ Cover Page
Packet count
Attack count
Anomaly count

2️⃣ Detailed Packet Logs
3️⃣ Severity-colored tables
4️⃣ Threat Intelligence Summary
